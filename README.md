🚀 Quick Start :

Step 1: Forking the repository :

To work on this project, you will first need to make a copy of this repository. To do this, you should fork the repository and then clone it so that you have a local working copy.

Get your own Fork/Copy of this repository by clicking Fork button at right upper corner of your screen.

Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository

After the repository is forked, you can now clone it so that you have a local working copy of the codebase.

To make your local copy of the repository follow the steps:

Open the Command Prompt

Type this command:

$ git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Hacktoberfest2021

Step 3: Creating a new branch

This is one of the very important step that you should follow to contribute in Open Source. A branch helps to manage the workflow, isolate your code and does not creates a mess. To create a new branch:

$ git branch <name_of_branch>

$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>

Keep your cloned repository upto to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

git pull origin main

Step 5: Contribute

Make relevant changes according to the issue that you were assigned on. Contribute in any way you feel like :)

Step 6: Commiting and Pushing

Once you have modified an existing file or added a new file to the project, you can add it to your local repository, which is being done with the git add command.

git add .

With our file staged, we’ll want to record the changes that we have made to the repository with the git commit command.

The commit message is an important aspect of your code contribution; it helps the other contributors fully understand the changes you have made, why you made it, and how significant it is.

git commit -m "useful commit message"

At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:

git push origin <branch-name>

Step 7: Create Pull Request

Now, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.

You should navigate to your forked repository, and press the "Compare & pull request" button on the page.

GitHub will alert you that you can merge the two branches because there is no competing code. You should add in a title, a comment, and then press the “Create pull request” button.
